# Screensaver Simulator 5000

"I SAW IT. I SAW IT AND IT WAS AMAZING." - Pamela Morgan Beesly

# Description

This app is terribly pointless. It's also my first React app and I needed something short to make.

Ever stare at those screensavers that scroll a box around and wait till it hits the corner, but it 
never does? I built this to simulate one of those screensavers, at speed, to find out how many times 
it would happen organically given enough time. I figured it'd be quicker to build this than to keep 
staring at the PLEX screensaver for another hour, or probably more.

You can change the size of the screen, the rate that the icon bounces around, and the time (ms) 
between ticks. I felt that was sufficient enough for something so beautifully pointless.
