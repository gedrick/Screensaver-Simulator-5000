# screensaver-sim-5000

"I SAW IT. I SAW IT AND IT WAS AMAZING."

This app is terribly pointless. It's also my first React app and I needed something short to make.

Ever stare at those screensavers that scroll a box around and wait till it hits the corner, but it 
never does? I built this to simulate one of those screensavers, at speed, to find out how many times 
it would happen organically given enough time. I figured it'd be quicker to build this than to keep 
staring at the PLEX screensaver for another hour, or probably more.
